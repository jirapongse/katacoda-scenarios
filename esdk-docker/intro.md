# Deploy and Run Elektron SDK in Docker

This tutorial demonstrates a way to deploy and run Elektron SDK's applications in the Docker platform. It starts with building a Docker image for Elektron SDK and then shows usages of this image including running the provider and consumer examples.

The [Elektron SDK](https://developers.refinitiv.com/elektron) is an open source API that aims to simplify development through a strong focus on ease of use and standardised access to a broad set of Refinitv and proprietary content and services. 

It contains five steps which are:
- Build the Elektron SDK Docker Image (30 minutes)
- Run a Provider example (2 minutes)
- Run a Consumer example (2 minutes)
- Stop and remove Docker containers (2 minutes)
- Access the shell command prompt to run other examples (4 minutes)
